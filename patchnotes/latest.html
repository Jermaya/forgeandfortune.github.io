                <p class="article_description">This major update brings with it a huge amount of new recipes, content and improvements along with introducing brand new features and gameplay mechanics, such as, heroes and adventures!</p>
                <p class="article_date">Initial Release: October 24th, 2018</p>

            <section class="article_notes">
                <h2>Recipes</h2>
                <p>The game now features a 300 different recipes to unlock and craft! 30 different item type lines with 10 recipes each!</p>
                <p>Recipes no longer take a specific amount of a resource to craft. Each recipe has a resource cost and possibly a material cost, the craft will utilize any worker of the appropriate level that produces that resource. While that worker is in use by that craft no other recipe can use the worker.</p>
                <p>For example, a Knife requires an Ore producing worker. Once you begin crafting the Knife recipe an Ore worker will be in use and no other recipe will be able to use that worker until you cancel the craft utilizing that worker.</p>
                <p>Recipes also now feature certain stats (HP, POW and/or ACT), these stats are important for a new feature introduced in this update called Adventures. Read more about Adventures below.</p>

                <h2>Workers</h2>
                <p>Now you can unlock 20 different workers with two different tiers of workers: 10 Standard workers and 10 Advanced workers.</p>
                <p>Each Standard worker produces a unique resource to allow crafting of different types of recipes. Unlocking an Advanced worker will provide you with another worker producing one of the 10 total resources available in-game allowing you to craft two recipes that use the same resource.</p>
                <p>Each worker (both Standard and Advanced) can be leveled up to 10 times allowing crafting of higher level recipes!</p>

                <h2>Inventory</h2>
                <p>New inventory system introduced. The inventory has been moved to its own page for easier management. Here you can check out your items and sell off what you no longer need or want and also equip directly to heroes.</p>

                <h2>Action Slots</h2>
                <p>Action slots have been moved to the right sidebar allowing you to view them on all pages and manage your crafts much easier.</p>
                <p>Auto-Sell Toggles have also been introduced and are located directly on action slots. Simply click the dollar sign to toggle between auto-selling nothing, all commons, goods and below, greats and below or epics and below. These toggles are on a per item basis, meaning your preference will be saved per item and not per slot.</p>

                <h2>Heroes</h2>
                <p>Introducing Heroes! A new feature and core gameplay mechanic. Unlock 12 unique heroes with varying classes, stats and equipment preferences.</p>
                <p>Each hero can be equipped with different items from weapons, armor, accessories and more! Power up your heroes’ stats including Power, HP and more with higher level items to further improve your adventuring experience!</p>
                <p>Each hero has a maximum level of 50, so get to grinding!</p>

                <h2>Adventures</h2>
                <p>Introducing Adventures! Another new feature and a key gameplay mechanic for gathering materials needed for crafting certain recipes and leveling your heroes!</p>
                <p>We’re launching with one adventure, Groovy Grove, so gather your heroes and best equipment and start your adventure for those valuable materials!</p>
                <p>Each recipe will have certain stats that will boost your performance in Adventures. Be sure to equip your heroes with the most powerful items you can craft!</p>

                <h2>Mail</h2>
                <p>New mail system introduced. Here you’ll receive messages from from various entities for completing certain tasks including adventures.</p>

                <h2>Progress</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>New progress tracker for version 0.2, track your mastery, worker levels, hero levels and overall game progress.</li>
                    <li>New game statistics for tracking how many items you’ve crafted, time played, maximum adventure floor reached and more.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>UI/UX Changes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>New logo to fit the new name.</li>
                    <li>New load screen with some cool load messages to distract you.</li>
                    <li>Retired light mode version of the site.</li>
                    <li>Retired compact mode, the site should now properly scale to fit most common screen sizes. Should you encounter an issue with your supported screen size, please contact us and we'll work on making some improvements.</li>
                    <li>Retired mobile support. Due to the extensive amount of features introduced and changes made, mobile support is not something we can effectively offer. This may change in the future as we work towards Version 1.0 but at the moment you'll need a device with a viewport width of at least 1250px.</li>
                    <li>New universal theme and color scheme. With the retirement of light mode, we’ve introduced a new universal theme. Based on previous surveyed feedback, dark mode was our most popular option -- this new theme leans on the darker side but with some improvements.</li>
                    <li>Improved design of all dialogs to now blur background and animate into focus amongst other improvements.</li>
                    <li>Added multiple animations and transition to various actions.</li>
                    <li>Improved tooltip appearance and animation.</li>
                    <li>Improved and added multiple identifying icons for certain buttons/actions.</li>
                    <li>Improved appearance of About & Crediting page.</li>
                    <li>Added “Back-to-Top” button for Release Notes and About & Crediting page.</li>
                    <li>A bunch of other improvements/changes that we honestly can’t remember because there are so many.</li>
                </ul>
